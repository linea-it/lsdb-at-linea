# Data

Welcome to the LIneA data documentation page. Here you will find information about available datasets and instructions on how to access them.


### User Profiles and Access Levels
LIneA offers different user profiles, each with specific access levels to the available data and services. To find out which services are available for each profile, please refer to the [table](https://docs.linea.org.br/en/sci-platforms/index.html#access-to-linea-services-and-platforms) available on the information page about the scientific platforms on the [user documentation](https://docs.linea.org.br/en/) site.

## [Catalogs](catalogs/index.md)

Access to tabular data (catalogs) is provided through different applications of the [LIneA Science Platform (LSP)](https://scienceplatform.linea.org.br/lsp), depending on the size, type, or access permission levels established by the originating astronomical survey.

To navigate, use the menu on the left and explore the different datasets organized according to usage options:

- **Download** and **programmatic access** with [LSDB](lsdb/index.md) (data in [HATS](https://hats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) format)
- **Query** in [databases](database/index.md), through the [User Query](https://userquery.linea.org.br/), [Jupyter Hub](https://jupyter.linea.org.br/), or [TAP Service](https://userquery.linea.org.br/cms/services/scripted-access/) platforms
- **Processing** in the HPC environment of data stored in the Lustre system, with access through the [Open OnDemand](https://ondemand.linea.org.br) platform
- **Visualization** of catalog information overlaid on [HiPS](images/hips.md) images

Below is a summary table of the main catalogs available for download or query through the different services:

## [Images](images/index.md)

Access to astronomical images is provided through different applications of the LIneA Science Platform, depending on the image type and the originating astronomical survey.

- [HiPS](images/hips.md) (Hierarchical Progressive Surveys) images: **global visualization** and **navigation** through the [Sky Viewer](https://skyviewer.org/) application, or for pointing to a pre-selected list of targets in the [Target Viewer](https://targetviewer.linea.org.br/).

- Coadded [FITS](images/fits/index.md) (Flexible Image Transport System) images: **download** of cutouts through the [Target Viewer](https://targetviewer.linea.org.br/), **programmatic access** via API through [Jupyter Hub](https://jupyter.linea.org.br/), or **processing** in the HPC environment, with access through the [Open OnDemand](https://ondemand.linea.org.br) platform.

- Single-exposure [FITS](images/fits/index.md) (Flexible Image Transport System) images: **programmatic access** via API through [Jupyter Hub](https://jupyter.linea.org.br/), or **processing** in the HPC environment, with access through the [Open OnDemand](https://ondemand.linea.org.br) platform.
